<h1>About Me</h1>
<p></p>

<p>Hello, I am Yekta Ã‡olak. I was born on November 15, 2008 in Turkey. Becoming a software developer has been my dream
  since 2023. I took my first step in 2024 by purchasing online courses through Udemy, and I plan to create projects
  using what I have learned and put them on places such as github. I'll update here as I progress.</p>
